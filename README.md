# 04.Music-genre-classification-using-Machine-Learning-algorithms

Using machine learning and digital signal processing techniques, we created a pipeline that classifies musical genres through a musical sound signal. The genres are blues, classical, country, disco, jazz, metal and pop. The construction of this pipeline is based on:

- Voice signal processing and feature engineering using Fourier transform and Wavelets. 

- Atypical data detection, data correlation, and information measurements.

- Implementation of supervised learning algorithms for music genre classification.

- Implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms for the analysis of musical groups, in order to find similarities between them.
